# Foundations of Cybersecurity — Detailed Notes

## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital threats. These threats may aim to steal information, disrupt services, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Cybersecurity focuses on identifying risks, reducing vulnerabilities, and responding effectively to incidents. Since it is impossible to eliminate all risks, the goal is to manage and reduce risk to an acceptable level.

## Importance of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is important because modern societies depend heavily on digital systems for communication, finance, healthcare, and government services. A single security breach can lead to financial loss, loss of trust, legal consequences, and operational downtime. Strong cybersecurity helps protect individuals, organizations, and critical infrastructure from these impacts.

## CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the foundation of all cybersecurity principles and decisions.

**Confidentiality** ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals. This is achieved through access controls, authentication, and encryption.

**Integrity** ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage, processing, and transmission. Mechanisms such as hashing, checksums, and version control help maintain integrity.

**Availability** ensures that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed. This includes protecting systems from outages, attacks, and hardware failures through redundancy and backups.

## Cyber Threats

Cyber threats are potential actions that can exploit vulnerabilities in systems.

**Malware** refers to malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware designed to damage or control systems.

**Phishing and social engineering** attacks manipulate users into revealing sensitive information or performing unsafe actions by exploiting trust and human behavior.

**Credential attacks** attempt to steal or guess usernames and passwords using techniques like brute force or credential stuffing.

**Insider threats** come from individuals within an organization who misuse their access, either intentionally or accidentally.

**Denial-of-Service attacks** aim to overwhelm systems or networks, making services unavailable to legitimate users.

## Defense-in-Depth

Defense-in-depth is a security strategy that uses multiple layers of protection to secure systems and data. Instead of relying on a single security control, multiple controls are implemented across people, processes, and technology. If one layer fails, another layer can prevent or reduce the impact of an attack. This approach increases resilience and reduces the likelihood of a complete security failure.

## Cybersecurity Domains

Cybersecurity is divided into different domains, each focusing on a specific area of protection.

**Network security** protects network infrastructure and traffic from unauthorized access and attacks.

**Endpoint security** focuses on protecting devices such as laptops, desktops, and servers.

**Application security** ensures software applications are designed and maintained securely.

**Cloud security** addresses security risks related to cloud-based systems and services.

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** controls who can access systems and what actions they are allowed to perform.

**Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** ensures that security practices align with policies, regulations, and organizational risk tolerance.

## Cybersecurity Roles

Cybersecurity involves different professional roles, each with specific responsibilities.

A **Security Analyst** monitors systems, investigates alerts, and helps protect organizations from threats.

A **SOC Analyst** works in a Security Operations Center, analyzing security events and responding to incidents.

An **Incident Responder** handles active security incidents and works to contain and recover from attacks.

A **Threat Intelligence Analyst** studies attacker behavior and emerging threats.

A **Penetration Tester** simulates attacks to identify weaknesses before real attackers exploit them.

---

## Frameworks and Standards

Frameworks and standards provide structured guidance for managing cybersecurity.

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** helps organizations identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.

**ISO/IEC 27001** defines requirements for establishing and maintaining an information security management system.

The **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** documents real-world attacker techniques and is used to understand and defend against threats.

## Ethics in Cybersecurity

Ethics play a critical role in cybersecurity. Professionals are trusted with sensitive data and system access, so they must act responsibly and lawfully. Ethical behavior includes respecting privacy, following organizational policies, using access only for authorized purposes, and reporting security issues honestly. Maintaining ethical standards helps build trust and credibility in the profession.

## Cybersecurity Tools

Cybersecurity tools help detect, prevent, and respond to threats.

**SIEM systems** collect and analyze security logs to identify suspicious activity.

**Firewalls** control network traffic based on predefined rules.

**IDS and IPS** monitor networks for malicious activity and can alert or block attacks.

**Endpoint protection tools** help secure individual devices from malware and exploits.

**Authentication systems** verify user identities and enforce access controls.
