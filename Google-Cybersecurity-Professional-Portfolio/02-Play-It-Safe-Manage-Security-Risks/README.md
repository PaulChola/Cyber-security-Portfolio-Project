# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

## Security Risk

Security risk refers to the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. In cybersecurity, risk is not just about attacks happening, but about the likelihood of an event occurring and the impact it would have on an organization. Managing risk means identifying what could go wrong, understanding how serious it would be, and taking steps to reduce or control it.

## Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Assets

An **asset** is anything valuable to an organization, such as data, systems, networks, or reputation.
A **threat** is any event or action that could cause harm to an asset, such as malware, human error, or natural disasters.
A **vulnerability** is a weakness that a threat can exploit, such as outdated software, weak passwords, or misconfigured systems.

Risk exists when a threat is capable of exploiting a vulnerability to impact an asset.

## Risk Management

Risk management is the ongoing process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and treating risks. The goal is not to eliminate all risks, but to reduce them to an acceptable level based on the organization’s priorities and resources. Effective risk management helps organizations make informed decisions about security investments and controls.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment involves identifying risks and determining their potential impact and likelihood. This process helps organizations prioritize which risks need immediate attention and which can be accepted or monitored. Risk assessments are usually repeated regularly to account for changes in systems, threats, and business operations.

## Risk Analysis

Risk analysis focuses on understanding how serious a risk is.

**Qualitative risk analysis** uses descriptive terms such as low, medium, or high to assess risk severity.

**Quantitative risk analysis** uses numerical values, such as financial cost or probability percentages, to measure risk. While quantitative analysis can be more precise, qualitative analysis is often more practical and commonly used.

## Risk Response Strategies

Once risks are identified and analyzed, organizations decide how to handle them.

**Risk mitigation** involves reducing risk by implementing security controls, such as firewalls, patches, or training.

**Risk avoidance** means eliminating the activity that creates the risk.

**Risk transfer** shifts risk to another party, such as through insurance or outsourcing.

**Risk acceptance** means acknowledging the risk and deciding it is acceptable without further action.

## Security Controls

Security controls are safeguards used to reduce risk. They are categorized based on their purpose and implementation.

**Administrative controls** include policies, procedures, training, and guidelines.

**Technical controls** include firewalls, encryption, access controls, and monitoring systems.

**Physical controls** include locks, security guards, badges, and surveillance cameras.

## Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege states that users should be given only the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions. Limiting access reduces the potential damage caused by compromised accounts, insider threats, or accidental misuse of systems.

---

## Separation of Duties

Separation of duties ensures that critical tasks are divided among multiple individuals. This reduces the risk of fraud, errors, and abuse of privileges by preventing any single person from having complete control over a sensitive process.

---

## Security Policies

Security policies define how an organization protects its assets and manages security risks. Policies provide clear rules and expectations for employees, contractors, and third parties. They help ensure consistency, accountability, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

---

## Compliance and Regulations

Compliance involves following laws, regulations, and standards that govern data protection and security practices. Failure to comply can result in legal penalties, financial losses, and reputational damage. Cybersecurity professionals must understand and support compliance efforts within their organizations.

## Incident Response and Risk

Incident response is closely tied to risk management. Organizations prepare for security incidents by developing response plans that outline roles, responsibilities, and procedures. Effective incident response reduces the impact of incidents and helps organizations recover quickly.

## Security Awareness and Training

Human behavior is a major factor in security risk. Security awareness training educates users on safe practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and protecting credentials. Well-trained users can significantly reduce organizational risk.
